                Rams introduced the idea of sustainable development, and of obsolescence being a crime in design, in the
                1970s. Accordingly, he asked himself the question: "Is my design a good design?" The answer he formed
                became the basis for his celebrated ten principles. According to him, "good design":
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is innovative</strong> The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted.
                Technological
                development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always
                develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>makes a product useful</strong> A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only
                functional, but also
                psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst
                disregarding anything that could detract from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is aesthetic</strong> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because
                products are
                used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be
                beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>makes a product understandable</strong> It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it
                can make the
                product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition. At best, it is
                self-explanatory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is unobtrusive</strong> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither
                decorative objects nor
                works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's
                self-expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is honest</strong> It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than
                it really is.
                It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is long-lasting</strong> It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
                Unlike fashionable
                design, it lasts many years – even in today's throwaway society.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is thorough down to the last detail</strong> Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care
                and accuracy in
                the design process show respect towards the consumer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is environmentally friendly</strong> Design makes an important contribution to the preservation
                of the
                environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle
                of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>is minimal</strong> Less is more. Simple as possible but not simpler. Good design elevates the
                essential
                functions of a product.
