            <p><em>영어 번역에 주의. 교재에서는 포화 이진 트리를 full binary tree로 번역하지만 위키피디아와 다른 자료에서 포화 이진 트리는 perfect binary tree이다.</em></p>
<p><em>이진 트리</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.

<p><em>정 이진 트리</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>포화 이진 트리</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>완전 이진 트리</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible</p>
